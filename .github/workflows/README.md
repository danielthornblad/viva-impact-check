# GitHub Actions workflows

Continuous integration pipelines will be defined here. Add workflows for tasks
such as linting, testing, preview deployments and production releases. Example
hooks for the API deployment should call the npm scripts in `apps/api/`, which
in turn operate on the shared `functions/` directory at the repository root.
